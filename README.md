## Features
TBD

## Setup
### 1. To develop Stream Fighters, you need Node.js and NPM

You can install it using NVM (Recommended):

Follow the instructions at the [NVM Git Repository](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

Alternatively, you can install it using your OS package manager or from the Node.js website.

### 2. Install dependencies (optionally you could install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)):

Navigate to the cloned repoâ€™s directory.

Run:

```npm install``` 

or if you choose yarn, just run ```yarn```

### 3. Run the development server:

Run:

```npm run dev```

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser.

Open your browser and enter localhost:3000 into the address bar.

Also this will start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser


## Build for deployment:

Run:

```npm run deploy```

This will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.

## Thanks

This game is based on the awesome Phaser + ES6 + Webpack project.
